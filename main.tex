\textbf{Theme:} A website for Cyber Security news.

\section{Background}

The topic of Cyber Security is an important topic that is relevant currently, and news related to it should be more well-known and accessible to the public eye.

At the moment, there are plenty of news websites out there, and one of our goals is help avoiding the need to open several sites at the same time, by letting the users look up at all the news from our website. 

We plan to make a website that show articles from several big news sources (e.g., CNN, Fox, MSN, etc.) and categorize that data into an easy-to-read format on our website. 

Our main focus for the website is the user's personalized experience. We plan to let user choose their own custom feed - such as which topics of cyber security and from which sources the news from, etc... as well as some quality-of-life features like saving articles, suggesting related articles,...
